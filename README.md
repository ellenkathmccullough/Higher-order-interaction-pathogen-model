# Higher-order-interaction-pathogen-model

This repository contains all the coding I have done in order to create a HOI model of tree pathogen interactions, where the involved agents undergo mutations. There are a number of files that I am no longer using, the ones that are currently in use are the HOI_model.py, the summary_statistics.py and the statistical_test_dummy.py. These files contain the main loop for the ecological and mutational simulation, the function for creating summary statistics and the loop that repeats multiple simulations and then scrapes out the summary statistics respectively. 

At the bottom of the HOI_model.py, I have also been attempting to do some curve fitting for the first ecological run, before any mutation has taken place. I am attempting to evaluate the cause of the shape of this initial distribution and to see if it is independent of the distribution from which the initial densities are drawm.
